# Time Tracker Application

Time Tracker is a tool for tracking user's spent time on a particular task.

Because of that Creation always involves building upon something else, I used this [Material](https://github.com/tuanngominh/react-time-tracking).
^^
## Tech Stack:

Web application based on React and Firebase.

* Frontend Library: ReactJS
* Server-side: Firebase.

## Features:
* Can start tracking with a single click.
* Can track time spent on time entry and stop a time entry tracking.
* Time is displayed in the hh:mm:ss format.
* The timer can be paused and resumed at any point of time. (Not properly yet)
* The ability to book time without the tracker (design done/logic not yet)
* Entries are saved in the database.
* Can list time entries.
* Delete time entry.
## To Use:

To clone and run this repository you'll need Git and Node.js (which comes with npm) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash

# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/wissal29/TimeTracking-Application.git

## What can be improved: 
* The UI.
* Adding statistics to record working hours weekly and monthly.

## Time spent:
